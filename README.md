# RayCastProto
Ray casting shader prototype using opengl

Move around using mouse + WSAD
Space to climb up and left shift to climb down
left control to activate faster movement

H - change shader mode (full shader -> pixelated -> depth only)
B - toggle directional light
P - pause time
Esc - exit

Adding or removing objects / lights / materials at runtime requires recompiling the shader however manipulating objects does not require recompilation
